        <h3>Getting to Know You</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! You’re getting married and you’re talking to us about your flowers. Our first step is an introductory phone call. We’ll talk about your wedding plans, how the two of you met, how he popped the question. Afterward we’ll send you a questionnaire to get some more detail about your event, but on this call we just want to get to know you better.</p>
